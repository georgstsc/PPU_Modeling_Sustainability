    "\n",
    "1. **`initialize_ppu_dictionary()`**\n",
    "   - Creates an empty DataFrame with all required columns\n",
    "   - Columns: PPU_ID, PPU_Name, PPU_Category, Chain_Efficiency, Cost_CHF_per_kWh, Cost_CHF_per_Quarter_Hour, Location_Rank, Components\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`add_ppu_to_dictionary()`**\n",
    "   - Adds a new PPU with automatic ID assignment (incremental)\n",
    "   - Calculates chain efficiency from components\n",
    "   - Calculates costs from cost_table_tidy.csv\n",
    "   - Automatically assigns location ranking for solar/wind PPUs\n",
    "   - Returns updated dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`next_available_location()`**\n",
    "   - Finds the next best available location for solar/wind PPUs\n",
    "   - Checks existing assignments to avoid duplicates\n",
    "   - Returns location details (rank, lat, lon, potential)\n",
    "   - Validates uniqueness across all renewable PPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`verify_storage_capacity()`**\n",
    "   - Analyzes storage usage across all PPUs\n",
    "   - Compares used capacity to available capacity\n",
    "   - Returns detailed report per storage type\n",
    "   - Shows which PPUs use each storage\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`verify_unique_locations()`**\n",
    "   - Ensures no two PPUs share the same location\n",
    "   - Detects and reports duplicate assignments\n",
    "   - Provides summary of all renewable PPU locations\n",

    "# 1. Initialize\n",
    "ppu_dictionary = initialize_ppu_dictionary()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Add PPUs\n",
